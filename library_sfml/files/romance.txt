Always And Forver, Lara Jean
Jenny Han 
Lara Jean is having the best senior year. And there’s still so much to look forward to: a class trip to New York City, prom with her boyfriend Peter, Beach Week after graduation, and her dad’s wedding to Ms. Rothschild. Then she’ll be off to college with Peter, at a school close enough for her to come home and bake chocolate chip cookies on the weekends. Life couldn’t be more perfect! At least, that’s what Lara Jean thinks . . . until she gets some unexpected news. Now the girl who dreads change must rethink all her plans—but when your heart and your head are saying two different things, which one should you listen to?

Book Lovers
Emily Henry
One summer. Two rivals. A plot twist they didn't see coming.... Nora Stephens’ life is books—she’s read them all—and she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby. Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sisters’ trip away—with visions of a small-town transformation for Nora, who she’s convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they’ve met many times and it’s never been cute. If Nora knows she’s not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he’s nobody’s hero, but as they are thrown together again and again—in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow—what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they’ve written about themselves.

Five Feet Apart
Rachael Lippincott, Mikki Daughtry, Tobias Iaconis
In this moving story two teens fall in love with just one minor complication—they can’t get within five feet of each other without risking their lives. Can you love someone you can never touch? Stella Grant likes to be in control—even though her totally out of control lungs have sent her in and out of the hospital most of her life. At this point, what Stella needs to control most is keeping herself away from anyone or anything that might pass along an infection and jeopardize the possibility of a lung transplant. Six feet apart. No exceptions. The only thing Will Newman wants to be in control of is getting out of this hospital. He couldn’t care less about his treatments, or a fancy new clinical drug trial. Soon, he’ll turn eighteen and then he’ll be able to unplug all these machines and actually go see the world, not just its hospitals. Will’s exactly what Stella needs to stay away from. If he so much as breathes on Stella she could lose her spot on the transplant list. Either one of them could die. The only way to stay alive is to stay apart. But suddenly six feet doesn’t feel like safety. It feels like punishment. What if they could steal back just a little bit of the space their broken lungs have stolen from them? Would five feet apart really be so dangerous if it stops their hearts from breaking too?

Requited Unrequited Love
Mina Ramzy
A full-fledged adult in the eyes of society, but not in the eyes of her mother, who follows the norms of their culture blindly. This is Kristina—a daughter of two Egyptian immigrant parents—and her doomed reality. She still lives at home and has absolutely zero freedom, both preventing her from crossing off the mundane items on her many bucket lists. As a psychology major, Kristina tries to cope—for instance, by talking with her pen pal, Adam, as her online persona, Eve. Even though she avoids men at all costs because of her past, he happens to be the only exception. Kristina is aware that if she were to get married, then—poof—magically, that would all change. Because by gaining a husband, she would be gaining her freedom, although compromising her detestation for her desire. It’s an unfortunate two-package deal, but the only solution. Enter Augustine and his—quite literal—proposal. The only problem? He’s a rude, arrogant, ill-mannered demon of a man who Kristina cannot stand. Neither can he stand her, but he has his own two-package deal—his own hidden gain. So, the feeling is mutual; they get married, pretend to love each other in front of others, and live their separate lives, keeping their distance from one another when no one is watching. Also mutual? They’re both unaware of the fact that they’re already close—as Adam and Eve. A win-win for all indeed. Strictly business. What could possibly go wrong? Other than facing a new set of mundane items, such as deception, love, and rejection.
